    <h1> THE SKYHOOK</h1>

    <p>
        SKY HOOK:
 An Informal History
<br>
A BRIEF OVERVIEW     

A Sky hook is something that is possible and can be done with today's technology, if the proper funding was ever acquired for such a large project. In a broad sense, a sky hook is a massive rotating piece of some sort that is orbiting the Earth, or any other celestial bodies with enough mass. When the hook on the Sky Hook catches a rocket, the rocket is carried along and given a massive and somewhat free energy boost when it is released, because of the momentum and centripetal force of the sky hook. Of course, that energy comes with a cost, both the extreme precision needed to attach, which is not great but worth noting, how to get it into the orbit,  and the energy that is taken from the rotating sky hook to accelerate the rocket, and there are several ideas on how to replenish this lost energy.

GETTING THE SKYHOOK TO ORBIT

While the skyhook might be a fast and efficient way to travel in space, it still has to get into an orbit to work. There are two leading ideas that are commonly used in rocketry that could be applied here. Firstly, the sky hook could be assembled on the ground, with all the major components already in place. This could then be loaded onto a gargantuan rocket, which would not be efficient, but would swiftly allow the sky hook to be in operation without months or years of construction in space. Lamentably, this method would be extremely expensive and inefficient, with the added effect of needing massive facilities to manufacture and assemble it on the ground, or an outdoor area, risking the rocket to the elements. With modern recovery techniques, such as landing used boosters and recovering them, these adverse effects could be somewhat alleviated, but this method would still add a significant cost to the project. There are also several other options to explore, which are much newer ideas that might work. One of them is the idea to launch it in separate pieces, which would then dock together to form the functional skyhook.
<br>

CATCHING MECHANISM

Some catching mechanisms call for an extendable claw or hook to latch onto the spacecraft. This claw would be very flexible, and able to move around quite a bit to make up for mistakes in launch, because it is impossible to get anywhere near 100% accuracy every launch. Rockets might have some sort of deployable hook that the claw could grab on to. The reliability of this could be improved by having several robotic arms, which would also allow several ships to be docked simultaneously. Another idea is to simply have it as another docking maneuver, just like a regular docking of ships to space stations. This would require slightly larger tanks for monopropellant / fuel and oxidizer on the actual payload to be accelerated, but would be much simpler and use pre - integrated systems. The RCS control could also be boosted with the use of cold gas thrusters or a more powerful small thruster. The advantage of the cold gas thruster would be simplicity and ease, but would not provide large amounts of thrust, although it could be refueled with the pressurized gas upon connecting to the skyhook.

KINETIC ENERGY REPLENISHMENT

Because energy is lost when the skyhook propels the spacecraft, the energy needs to be replaced or the skyhook will not spin. There are several ways to do this. One way is to simply just keep the engines running and use that energy. This method might seem easy enough until consideration goes into how much fuel that would need and how to get it there. The engine would only need to fire after the skyhook boosted a spacecraft, but this would happen up to almost 12 times a day, so this option is possible, but more expensive. Another option is to deorbit a spacecraft of around the same mass as the one it gave the additional speed to. The only cost of this option would be the additional computation needed to align the spacecraft with the skyhook, but this cost would be very small compared to others. This would work and would be almost free compared to other options, considering the massive scale of which computers are already used in rocketry today.

<br>
BUILDING MATERIAL

The material needed for this project would need to be very durable and strong. This is not a space elevator concept, so tensile strength would not be as important, but the craft needs to be able to stand the stress from spinning, and therefore, accelerating a rocket. This can be easily solved with carbon fiber,  but the lightweight material might betray itself.  If the structure as a whole is too light, it will not be able to efficiently accelerate spacecraft. Lightweight and strong material can be used, but may not be sufficient alone. One plan to fool-proof this design would be to add lots of weight, while still in the range of feasibility, making sure the sky hook has enough momentum to accelerate the rocket and keep spinning. This additionally would allow for future expansion, increasing the lifetime of this project. This would as a side effect increase the cost at launch, but it could be calculated to have nominal weight and momentum. As the tensile strength of the sky hook is not required to be as high, steel or other alloys could be used if the proper calculations were run. The speed could also be increased,  as momentum = mv,  or mass times velocity. This would be by far the cheapest option, and would have the same effect as both are multiplied together, but the method for speeding it up may have inefficiencies or not be able to keep the rotational velocity necessary for optimal use. [ See â€˜Kinetic Energy Replacement ] The other advantage of having more momentum stored up is less required reboosting, as the momentum given to a spacecraft upon boosting represents a smaller part of the whole.




<br>
GETTING TO THE SKYHOOK

The skyhook does have contact with the ground like a theoretical space elevator would, so the payload needs some way to reach the skyhook. This could be feasible with traditional rockets or a newer solution, mass drivers. Traditionally built chemical rockets have the potential to fulfill the design requirements, but the fundamental way that these chemical rockets work - cryogenic or hypergolic -  may limit their usability for this circumstance. The first holdback is the cost. Traditional rockets can be very expensive from the high part count to the complex assembly, which is adverse to the motive behind the skyhook, cheap and efficient space travel. Also, there are a high number of flight cancellations due to adverse weather / rocket failures in the chemical rocketry world. This could delay scheduled shipping routes, which are a prominent part of the skyhooks potential purpose. With the sky hook orbiting in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), it will pass over a single point in its orbit nearly twelve times daily. With chemical based traditional rockets, this may be too rapid and only a few of the passovers would be used, unless several launch sites dedicated to the program were built, adding significant construction fees to the project. The other concept for consideration is a mass driver. A mass driver could use electromagnets in a tube to propel the spacecraft to the skyhook. {See mass drivers} This device is similar to a coil gun, although a railgun type propulsion system could also be used. A sled could be used to contain the payload that would separate after launch, and this sled could short the contacts, accelerating the sled and transferring its momentum to the payload. Using these systems in conjunction could maximize the efficiency and continually lower the cost of getting a payload to space. Using a large enough mass driver with a sky hook could result in a minimized, if not removed second stage, as the mass driver would provide the initial velocity, with the sky hook then propelling it further. The only propellant would be the smaller engines that would adjust the trajectory ( RCS ), although these may need to be constructed larger to use efficently. Using this technology would mean that very little propellant would be needed onboard if the craft were only traveling short distances ( Around geostationary orbit or lower, if it was a near perfect launch and momentum transfer, with the RCS engines being large enough ). The result would be a much lower cost to put payload into orbit, and also increase the amount of payload that each launch could carry. The only instance where a second stage would be needed is when the spacecraft needs to go to other orbits, where it needs more power to perform the final maneuvers or additional thrust is needed to reach the nominal trajectory / deorbit at the destination. If missions were going on these longer journeys, a sky hook system could be built to reduce the already minimal propellant load onboard {See Skyhooks in A System}.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH BUILDING A SKYHOOK

The risks with building a sky hook are some of the same dangers of building any sort of craft in space. Collision with space debris is a large concern with space elevators and sky hooks. Because of the large size of the sky hook, the surface area is also large so there is a greatly increased chance for space debris to hit it. One solution is charting and keeping track of space debris so the sky hook can adjust accordingly and/or redirect the debris. This is what the Space Surveillance Network(SSN) does. It is not usually considered a feasible option to push the space debris away, as it would increase costs. This could be possible, but would be an inefficient way to protect the sky hook unless the space debris could be recycled, which would be hard to do and potentially too costly to operate. A way this concept may operate, if found feasible, is to have a shielded tether that could have small robotic arms to capture any space debris and bring it to the center of the tether, at geostationary orbit. There, a small space station that could send the debris in reusable rockets to be recycled on earth. This would get rid of space debris and additionally a space agency could use this material to build rockets, which is good for the environment since no new material is made, and is very cost efficient in terms of just material and no original costs, there is no price except for getting it back to Earth. This may also increase publicity, because it is reducing the amount of pollution in the space and simultaneously not needing any new material mined out. This of course comes with a price. The increase in funding needed to build something like this would be enormous and might not even make it worth catching space debris at all. Another very small risk is hitting another satellite, because it is a giant satellite itself, and is orbiting in LEO, or another orbit in other celestial bodies' spheres of influence. Of course, this risk applies to all satellites, and simple satellite tracking that is already in place will fix this problem, if cooperation with any satellites that orbits needs to be moved goes well. The last risk is funding. The first time a project like this is built, billions of dollars more will go into research and development to even get the technicalities of such a massive project. Then again, this applies to all newer spacecraft. Lastly, a problem is with keeping it in orbit. The torque created by a rapidly rotating long piece of metal in space has to be considered. Possibly it could extend the same length in the opposite direction to possibly counteract torque or have a weight that would be calibrated so the center of mass, where things always rotate around, would be in the correct location. This weight could be some sort of space station, to increase efficiency and additionally add an easy to access hub for space-wide transportation. This area could also be used for some sort of storage, for water or other materials that are hard to come by in space. {See â€˜Expansion of Systemâ€™ and â€˜A Skyhook Highwayâ€™}

SOME OF MY ADDITIONAL IDEAS

My first idea is a 2 in 1 situation. At the very center of the skyhook, there would be a 232 meter long section which, at the end, could be inhabited by humans. If the skyhook was spinning at about 2 rpm, then the area that humans can be in would have artificial gravity. If we wanted to lower the RPM, then we would have to extend the habitable zone by several hundred meters. Ater doing that the RPM could be lowered  but still have artificial gravity equal 1 g. This could be the first artificial gravity in space and an effective skyhook. This would also add more weight to the sky hook, which would help increase momentum, with the small setback of a more expensive launch. To make this work better, a small lifting mechanism could be on the end and when the rocket comes into contact, resources can be lifted to the station very cheaply. This reduces the cost of getting science experiments on a spacecraft, so larger and more experiments can be done. If some technicalities could be worked out, such as how to keep it properly aligned, a telescope could also be built cheaply. This also allows an outpost to be built where ships that have expended their fuel getting to orbit can be sent on a journey, with a full tank for extra boosts or other supplies that need to be replenished.

[please note that none of the above has been considered or tested for actual feasibility, and ideas can be expanded upon or completely disregarded.]

 PROBLEMS WITH THE FEASIBILITY OF THE SKYHOOK
Because the option of launching individual pieces of the skyhook is the most feasible one, something like that could be built, but would come with its own problems. This is a good solution until the skyhook is required to begin itâ€™s functionality, which means giving it some degree of rotation. There are different options, but some aren't very feasible in ways of how many technicalities they would produce. The first choice is larger launch would start the skyhook and start rotating immediately. This would be the human inhabitable section, and would dock on to other modules later on in the building process. The main flaw in this plan is that if the main module is already spinning, the difficulty is increased a hundred - fold when other modules or expansions must be added. This would either require the section to stop rotating, of to somehow rotate the new modules around it, which would require expensive and immoderate uses of the fuel onboard, which would already be minimal. The secondary solution is similar in many ways, but is a more feasible approach to the problem. First, the main module would be launched, but would not be rotating. This makes it much easier to dock, as many dockings have been made in similar conditions to this one. After everything has docked together, there are ways to start rotating. The skyhook could capture a spacecraft traveling in close proximity to it, using its inertia to begin its rotation. This could be done several times until the period of rotation is satisfactory. An additional procedure that could be used is the rocketry method. This could involve several thrusters placed on both ends of the device, firing in sync to begin its rotation. This could be fuel costly, but efficient engines could be used to minimize losses.  Another flaw in the skyhook has to do with using them in a system. For this idea to work, another skyhook has to be built and shipped to another celestial body. This creates many concerns, since a skyhook is a very large structure and getting it to another orbit would be very challenging, not to add  the additional cost of deorbit burns, since there would be nothing in that orbit to help stop it from escaping the sphere of influence, (SOI) of that planet or moon. A skyhook could be built to send it to the area, but this would require many shipments and still would face deorbit burns, which would be numerous and costly. The final obstacle facing the construction of this structure would be the balance of the rotation.

SKYHOOKS IN A SYSTEM
Because sky hooks can be used to send a spacecraft to space and deorbit spacecraft, they could be used in a system. One sky hook could send the skyhook to space, or another celestial body that a sky hook is orbiting around, and that sky hook could deorbit the payload to the space they needed to be. This could be very efficient, since once it has met with the first skyhook, very few burns are necessary, because the sky hookâ€™s release could be timed with precision to accelerate it in the right direction to the target. Then, after the rocket has made its journey through space, no deorbit burn will be necessary because of the skyhook there. This results in a fairly efficient system, because not much fuel is needed. If the ship had Ion Engines, then it would be even more efficient, since not much thrust would be needed and that perfectly matches the Ion engines' skill set. The setback of this idea is that a skyhook has to be sent to the other orbit and because skyhooks are so large, this could result in major problems. One way to minimize this would be to send individual pieces up to orbit, essentially creating another skyhook, but then not rotate it and put some form of thrust to push it to the orbit. Once in the desired orbit, the sky hook could begin to rotate to begin functioning. This system would be fast-moving and quick, since supply routes can be sent on a day-to-day basis from earth, as it passes over a location twelve times daily, and other 
<br>
EXPANSION OF SYSTEM
Once a system of skyhooks were built, they could be used to further expand the system, if placed correctly. Another sky hook could be built on Earth, using the sky hook there to go to space, and then using the second sky hook to further propel it to its destination. This method would still require deorbit burns, but any new infrastructure will, and it is unavoidable. The process could keep repeating, building a skyhook highway system of sorts. This reliable network could be used to develop supply chains to other colonies elsewhere in space. It could also be used to resupply longer missions, stopping at a skyhook for a few days, getting a kinetic energy boost, then leaving towards the next destination.
<br>
A SKYHOOK HIGHWAY
Using the system that could be built [See â€˜Expansion of Systemâ€™] a highway of sorts could be constructed in space, with planned supply chains and delivery routes. This would greatly improve humanity's ability to efficiently transport goods to other planets, and something similar would be necessary to get resources to bases/colonizations on other planets. A powerful modeling computer could be used to plan schedules for delivery of goods and parts, expansion of bases, and other miscellaneous cargo that needed to be shipped. Using this planning, a systematic delivery system would be created, more reliable than the unpredictable launches of rockets that happen today.
